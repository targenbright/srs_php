School Registration System in PHP

This School Registration System was built using MySQL, PHP, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It was made to strengthen my relational database planning before programming even began. PHP was used in this project to develop additional backend languages for myself.

The purpose of this SRS is to perform class registration, personal information updates, and information review for K-12 students, parents, and faculty. Students will have basic access to their information and their parents' information. Parents will be able to register a student for classes during a registration period for classes. They will only be shown courses available to that particular student. Faculty will be able to review courses they have been assigned to teach and can assign final grades for each student. A principal can create courses and assign teachers to them.
